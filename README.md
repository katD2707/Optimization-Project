A solution for multiple (minimax) asymmetric travelling salesman problem (m-ATSP)

Problem: Allocate work to workers

• There are N customers 1, 2, …, N need to maintain the internet network. Customer i is at location i (i = 1,…,N)

• Maintenance for customer i lasts d(i) time unit(s)

• There are K technical staffs at the company's headquarters (point 0) and has a starting time of t0 = 0.

• Travel time from point i to point j takes t(i,j)

• Plan to assign maintenance staff to customers so that the maximum working time (travel time plus maintenance time) of a certain employee is minimal.


Code and idea based mostly from the paper "Tournament Selection Algorithm for the Multiple Travelling Salesman Problem" of Giorgos Polychronis & Spyros Lalis with some adjustments and comments.
